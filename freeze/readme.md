# Goal: 

Write a class that analyses freezes in a video.

The desired behaviour of the class

```{python}
video_path = "my_video.avi"
processor = FreezeProcessor()
freezing_events = processor.process_data(video_path)
```

## Things you'll need to do

1. Access the functions from ezTrack that. You can either copy and paste them into the file, or make them methods of FreezeProcessor.
2. Write the process_data method of FreezeProcessor. You will use the functions from ezTrack to do this.
